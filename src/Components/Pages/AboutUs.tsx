                <p className='pb-5'>
                    To improve the effectiveness and usability of the Portal for our Users, we use “cookies”, or such similar electronic tools to collect information to assign each visitor a unique random number as a User Identification (User ID) to understand the User’s individual interests using the identified computer. Unless the User voluntarily identifies himself/herself (e.g., through registration), Pro11Club has no way of knowing who the User is, even if we assign a cookie to the User’s computer. The only personal information a cookie can contain is information supplied by the User. A cookie cannot read data off the User’s hard drive. Pro11Club’s advertisers may also assign their own cookies to the User’s browser (if the User clicks on their ad banners), a process that Pro11Club does not control. Pro11Club’s web servers automatically collect limited information about User’s computer’s connection to the Internet, including User’s IP address, when the User visits the Portal. (User’s IP address is a number that lets computers attached to the Internet know where to send data to the User – such as the web pages viewed by the User). The User’s IP address does not identify the User personally. Pro11Club uses this information to deliver its web pages to Users upon request, to tailor its Portal to the interests of its users, to measure traffic within the Portal and let advertisers know the geographic locations from where Pro11Club’s visitors come.

Once the User leaves Pro11Club’s servers (the User can tell where he/she is by checking the URL in the location bar on the User’s browser), use of any information provided by the User is governed by the privacy policy of the operator of the site which the User is visiting.
